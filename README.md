# Linkedin CV

Linkedin profile doesn't make a good curriculum vitae, nor the downloadable PDF file does. Moreover, maintaining a Linkedin profile and a CV file is a duplicated work that you would love to avoid.

Now, you can maintain your Linkedin profile and guarantee that you will be able to print it or export it to a PDF file using the "Safe to PDF" printer in Google Chrome.

This Google Chrome extension will add a small Linkedin button to the right of your browser address bar (The Omnibar). If you click this button while you are viewing a Linkedin profile - providing that you have the permission to see that profile - the profile will turn into a nice and printable CV.
